    <h2>What is Unison.js</h2>

    <p><strong>Unison.js</strong> is a small plugin (450 bytes minified, 144 bytes gzipped) that allows you to declare named breakpoints in one place and automatically sync them across your javascript and markup. When all of your front-end technologies share breakpoint information, complex responsive tasks such as conditional loading and image swapping become much simpler and straight-forward.</p>

    <h2>How does it work</h2>

    <p>To take full advantage of Unison.js, you'll need to be using a css pre-processor such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a>, <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/" target="_blank">Stylus</a>. Currently, Unison is only set up to use SASS, but LESS and Stylus implimentations are on the way. To begin, declare your breakpoints in your <a href="https://github.com/bjork24/Unison/blob/master/css/_breakpoints.scss#L4-L11" target="_blank"><em>_breakpoints.scss</em></a> partial as you normally would:</p>

<pre>
$usn-x-small         : 200px;
$usn-small           : 400px;
$usn-small-medium    : 600px;
$usn-medium          : 800px;
$usn-large-medium    : 1000px;
$usn-large           : 1200px;
$usn-x-large         : 1400px;
</pre>

    <p>These are the breakpoint names that you'll use in your markup and javascript to trigger events as well. This is the only place in your project that you'll need to declare your breakpoints. Whenever these values change, they'll be synced across your code automatically. After you've declared your breakpoints, you'll need to include the names in a second block so the CSS can pass them to the javascript.</p>

<pre>
$mq-sync:
  usn-x-small        $usn-x-small,
  usn-small          $usn-small,
  usn-small-medium   $usn-small-medium,
  usn-medium         $usn-medium,
  usn-large-medium   $usn-large-medium,
  usn-large          $usn-large,
  usn-x-large        $usn-x-large
;
</pre>

    <p>This bit of code may look redundant, but it's required to broadcast the names of each breakpoint outside of your stylesheet -- or at least until SASS figures out a way to parse variable variables. As mentioned in the comments of <a href="https://github.com/bjork24/Unison/blob/master/css/_breakpoints.scss#L13-L24" target="_blank"><em>_breakpoints.scss</em></a>, if you ever change the name of your break point, you'll have to update it in this block as well. Once you've named and declared your breakpoints, place the <strong>Unison.js</strong> script on your page:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="unison.min.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>

    <p>And that's all there is to it! You're named breakspaces are now available in any of your javascript files. To test, open your javascript console and type <em>Unison.getBreakpoints()</em>. If everything is set up correctly, the console will return two objects: one with your current breakpoint's name and value, and a second containing a hash of the other breakpoints you declared in your <em>_breakpoints.scss</em> file.</p>

    <h2>Interacting with breakpoint data</h2>

    <p>While building out your responsive design, it's helpful to see which breakpoint you're currently working with, and <strong>Unison.js</strong> makes that data easily available. Simply set <em>$debug: true;</em> in your <em>_breakpoints.scss</em> file and your current breakpoint data will be appended to your page for easy debugging. To see this in action, click the "Toggle breakpoint info" button at the top of the page and resize your browser.</p>

    <p>You can access the breakpoint objects from your javascript by calling <em>Unison.getBreakpoints()</em>, or by chaining off the object to drill down for more specific data.</p>

<pre>
var breakpointData = Unison.getBreakpoints();

// breakpointData = {
//   allBP : {
//     usn-large : "1200px"
//     usn-large-medium : "1000px"
//     usn-medium : "800px"
//     usn-small : "400px"
//     usn-small-medium : "600px"
//     usn-x-large : "1400px"
//     usn-x-small : "200px"
//   },
//   currentBP : {
//     name : "usn-large"
//     width : "1200px"
//   }
// }

var allBreakpoints = Unison.getBreakpoints().allBP;

// allBreakpoints = {
//   usn-large : "1200px"
//   usn-large-medium : "1000px"
//   usn-medium : "800px"
//   usn-small : "400px"
//   usn-small-medium : "600px"
//   usn-x-large : "1400px"
//   usn-x-small : "200px"
// }

var currentBPval = Unison.getBreakpoints().currentBP.width;

// currentBPval = "1200px"
